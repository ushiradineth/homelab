# üß™ Homelab Configuration

- This repository consists of code that helps me boot up my 'home server' from scratch with a few simple commands.
- My motivation for this is due to my old laptop failing beyond repair at times which requires me to restart configuration from the beginning.

### üìñ Playbooks

- nixos

  - Purpose: To generate and build the NixOS configuration.
  - Command: `ansible-playbook -i user@host, nixos.yml --ask-become-pass`
  - Note: --ask-become-pass is required as this playbook needs to build and update the OS.

- dotfiles

  - Purpose: To pull and stow dotfiles.
  - Command: `ansible-playbook -i user@host, dotfiles.yml --ask-become-pass`
  - Note: --ask-become-pass is required as this playbook creates the dotfiles for the root user aswell.

- docker

  - Purpose: To create docker configuration and deploy the services.
  - Command: `ansible-playbook -i user@host, docker.yml`
  - Note:
    - This playbook will create a .env file and return early if the .env file is not found on the remote machine, ensure that this is filled as needed.
    - This playbook will not restart services when environment variables change as this does not keep track of them, restart the services manually if the environment variables do change.

  - Check if the default SSH port is changed to a custom one.
  - Set the SSH Port to the port which the script can connect to successfully.

  - Build and switch to the new configuration if the configuration.nix file is changed.
